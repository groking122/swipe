      "taskTitle": "Implement Authentication with Clerk",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Clerk authentication implementation into subtasks covering SDK installation, provider setup, UI component creation, middleware implementation, Supabase synchronization, and custom hook development.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication is inherently complex, requiring secure implementation across multiple systems. This task involves third-party integration (Clerk), multiple auth providers, middleware for protected routes, and synchronization with Supabase, making it significantly complex."

      "taskTitle": "Create User Profiles and Statistics",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the user profile development into subtasks covering profile page UI creation, upload history display, statistics calculation and display, API endpoint implementation, and profile editing functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves aggregating and displaying user data from multiple sources. The complexity lies in calculating statistics, creating an intuitive UI for different profile sections, and implementing editing capabilities."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Basic Feed Algorithm",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the feed algorithm implementation into subtasks covering ranking logic development, API endpoint creation, pagination implementation, caching strategy, filtered view implementation, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Algorithmic content ranking is inherently complex. This task requires balancing multiple factors (recency, popularity), implementing efficient database queries, managing pagination, and optimizing performance with caching strategies."

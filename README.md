## Database Setup

MemeSwipe uses Supabase for database and storage. The application includes several scripts to help set up and maintain the database:

### Key Database Scripts

1. **init-storage.js**: Initializes the required storage buckets in Supabase.
   ```bash
   npm run init-storage
   ```
   This script creates the following buckets:
   - `meme-images`: For storing uploaded meme images
   - `user-avatars`: For storing user profile pictures

2. **fix-database.js**: Ensures the database schema is correctly set up or fixed if needed.
   ```bash
   npm run fix-db
   ```
   This script applies the SQL definitions from `supabase-setup.sql` to create or update:
   - Tables (memes, interactions, users)
   - Row-level security policies
   - Indexes for performance
   - Stored functions for business logic

3. **prepare-deploy**: A combined script that runs both initialization scripts before deployment.
   ```bash
   npm run prepare-deploy
   ```

### Database Schema

The database includes the following main tables:

- **memes**: Stores meme content including title, image path, and status
- **interactions**: Records user interactions with memes (likes, shares, saves)
- **users**: Mirrors Clerk user data with additional app-specific fields

Additional features:

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Ensures users can only access and modify their own data
- **Upload Limits**: Premium users get higher monthly upload quotas
- **Soft Deletion**: User accounts and content are never permanently deleted
